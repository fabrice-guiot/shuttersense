# Photo Statistics Configuration Template
# Copy this file to config.yaml and customize it for your needs
#
# This file defines:
# 1. Which file types are considered photo/image files
# 2. Which file types REQUIRE XMP sidecar files
# 3. What metadata sidecar extensions are valid

# File types that should be scanned
# All extensions listed here will be counted in statistics
photo_extensions:
  - .dng      # DNG files (already contain metadata, no sidecar needed)
  - .tiff     # TIFF files (already contain metadata, no sidecar needed)
  - .tif      # TIFF files (already contain metadata, no sidecar needed)
  - .cr3      # Canon CR3 RAW (requires XMP sidecar)
  # Uncomment or add additional formats as needed:
  # - .nef     # Nikon RAW (requires XMP sidecar)
  # - .arw     # Sony RAW (requires XMP sidecar)
  # - .orf     # Olympus RAW (requires XMP sidecar)
  # - .rw2     # Panasonic RAW (requires XMP sidecar)
  # - .pef     # Pentax RAW (requires XMP sidecar)
  # - .raf     # Fujifilm RAW (requires XMP sidecar)
  # - .raw     # Generic RAW (requires XMP sidecar)
  # - .crw     # Canon RAW older (requires XMP sidecar)
  # - .cr2     # Canon RAW (requires XMP sidecar)
  # - .jpg     # JPEG (may or may not need sidecar)
  # - .jpeg    # JPEG (may or may not need sidecar)

# File types that REQUIRE XMP sidecar files
# Only these will be flagged as "orphaned" if they don't have a matching .xmp file
# Note: DNG and TIFF typically embed metadata, so they don't need sidecars
require_sidecar:
  - .cr3
  # Uncomment formats that require sidecars in your workflow:
  # - .nef
  # - .arw
  # - .orf
  # - .rw2
  # - .pef
  # - .raf
  # - .raw
  # - .crw
  # - .cr2

# Valid metadata sidecar file extensions
