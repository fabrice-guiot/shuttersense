# Application Naming Proposals

**Status:** Draft - Under Review
**Created:** 2026-01-11
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-11

---

## Executive Summary

This document captures naming proposals for the photo-admin application rebrand. The current name "photo-admin" is functional but lacks market appeal and brand identity. These proposals aim to find a name that is:

- Memorable and catchy
- Evocative of photography
- Suggestive of workflow/organization/insights
- Professional and modern
- Available as a domain (ideally .com or .io)

---

## Application Value Proposition

Based on the [domain model](../domain-model.md), the application offers:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Workflow Pipelines** | Directed graph processing from capture to archive |
| **Event Management** | Calendar-based shoot planning, logistics, attendance |
| **Multi-Storage Orchestration** | Unified management of local, S3, GCS, SMB storage |
| **Analytics & Insights** | Camera usage, workflow efficiency, bottleneck detection |
| **Subject Tracking** | Image-to-performer tagging with AI/ML assist potential |
| **Collection Analysis** | Orphan detection, sidecar validation, pattern analysis |

### Target Users

- Professional photographers (studio, event, sports/wildlife)
- Hobbyist photographers managing personal collections
- Photography teams sharing resources

### Competitive Landscape

[Snappr Workflows](https://www.snappr.com/workflows) targets enterprise content marketing teams with no-code automation. Our application is more **photographer-centric**, focusing on the individual/team photographer's workflow from event planning through final archive.

## Top 3 Recommendations

| Rank | Name | Rationale | Domain Status |
|------|------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | **ShutterForge** | Strong, professional; "forge" suggests powerful workflow building and craftsmanship | **TAKEN** - Active photography hosting platform |
| 2 | **LensFlow** | Clean, intuitive; immediately communicates photography + workflow/pipeline | **LIKELY TAKEN** - lensflow.app exists (CRM for photographers) |
| 3 | **PhotoOps** | DevOps-inspired; suggests operational excellence; professional feel; appeals to tech-savvy photographers | **PARKED** - Shows "Coming Soon" page; may be acquirable |

### Notes on Top 3

- **PhotoOps** resonates with users from software development backgrounds (DevOps, GitOps, MLOps pattern)
- **ShutterForge** and **LensFlow** have strong brand potential but face domain challenges
- Consider alternative TLDs (.io, .app, .photo) for any taken .com domains
