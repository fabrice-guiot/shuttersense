# Feature Specification: ShutterSense.ai Application Rebrand

**Feature Branch**: `020-shuttersense-rebrand`
**Created**: 2026-01-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Rebrand photo-admin application to ShutterSense.ai with tagline 'Capture. Process. Analyze.' Complete name replacement across codebase, new logo assets, GitHub repository rename."

---

## Overview

This specification covers the complete rebranding of the "photo-admin" application to **ShutterSense.ai**. The rebrand includes visual identity (logo, favicon), naming conventions across all code and documentation, and repository/infrastructure updates. This rebrand prepares the application for its first official production release at `https://app.shuttersense.ai`.

| `https://api.shuttersense.ai`    | API endpoints (future, dedicated subdomain)  |

**Note**: Production deployment is HTTPS-only (port 443).

### Name Usage Guidelines

| Context                            | Format          | Example                                       |

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - See Updated Branding in Application (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see the new ShutterSense.ai branding when I open the application so that I recognize the updated product identity.

**Why this priority**: Visual branding is the most visible aspect of the rebrand and creates immediate user recognition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the application and visually verifying the new logo appears in the header, login page, and favicon.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is loaded, **When** I view the top-left corner of the sidebar, **Then** I see the ShutterSense.ai logo
2. **Given** I am on the login page, **When** the page renders, **Then** I see the high-resolution 3D logo prominently displayed
3. **Given** I have the application open in a browser tab, **When** I view the browser tab, **Then** I see the ShutterSense favicon
4. **Given** I am on any page, **When** I view the browser title bar, **Then** the title includes "ShutterSense.ai"

---

### User Story 2 - Updated CLI Tools Reflect New Brand (Priority: P2)

As a developer or power user running CLI tools, I want to see the new branding in version output and help text so that the tools feel cohesive with the web application.

**Why this priority**: CLI tools are frequently used by technical users who expect consistent branding.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running any CLI tool with `--version` or `--help` flags and verifying new name appears.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I run `python3 photo_stats.py --version`, **When** the version displays, **Then** I see "ShutterSense" in the output
2. **Given** I run any CLI tool with `--help`, **When** help text displays, **Then** references use "ShutterSense" instead of "photo-admin"
3. **Given** I generate an HTML report from any tool, **When** I view the report footer, **Then** it displays "Generated by ShutterSense.ai"

---

### User Story 3 - Documentation Uses New Branding (Priority: P2)

As a user reading documentation, I want all references updated to ShutterSense.ai so that documentation is consistent with the application.

**Why this priority**: Documentation is a key touchpoint for new and existing users.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by searching documentation files for old brand names and verifying none remain.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I read the README.md, **When** I see project references, **Then** they use "ShutterSense.ai" or "ShutterSense"
2. **Given** I read any documentation file, **When** I search for "photo-admin" or "PhotoAdmin", **Then** no matches are found
3. **Given** I view the API documentation at `/docs`, **When** the page loads, **Then** the title shows "ShutterSense.ai API"

---

### User Story 4 - Repository and GitHub Reflect New Brand (Priority: P3)

As a developer cloning or viewing the repository, I want to see the new brand name so that the GitHub presence is consistent.

**Why this priority**: Repository rename impacts external perception but can be done after core code changes.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by visiting the GitHub repository URL and verifying new name and description.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I visit the GitHub repository, **When** the page loads, **Then** the repository name is "shuttersense" or "shuttersense.ai"
2. **Given** I view the repository description, **When** it displays, **Then** it includes "ShutterSense.ai" and the tagline
3. **Given** I visit the old repository URL, **When** the page loads, **Then** I am redirected to the new repository URL

---

### User Story 5 - Environment Variables Use New Prefix (Priority: P3)

As a developer configuring the application, I want environment variables to use the new SHUSAI prefix so that configuration is consistent with the rebrand.

**Why this priority**: Environment variable changes are part of the complete rebrand effort.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting environment variables with new prefix and verifying application reads them correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I set `SHUTTERSENSE_VERSION` environment variable, **When** the application starts, **Then** it uses this value
2. **Given** I view documentation for environment variables, **When** I read the configuration guide, **Then** variables are documented with `SHUSAI_` prefix

### Edge Cases

- How does the system handle mixed branding during a partial deployment? → Frontend and backend should be deployed together to avoid visual inconsistencies.
- What happens to existing database records that might contain the old application name? → Any stored application name references should be updated via migration.
- What happens to browser localStorage/sessionStorage that might cache old branding? → The application clears any cached branding-related data on first load after rebrand.

---

## Assumptions

1. The user will provide the logo files in appropriate source formats (high-resolution PNG or vector SVG)
2. GitHub repository rename can be performed by the repository owner
3. CLI tool script names (photo_stats.py, photo_pairing.py) will be renamed to match new brand
4. No database schema changes are required (application name is not stored in database)
5. No backward compatibility is required as Photo Admin was never officially released (pre-release only)
6. DNS and SSL certificate configuration for app.shuttersense.ai is handled separately (out of scope)

---

## Out of Scope

1. Complete redesign of UI color scheme or typography (only logo/name changes)
2. Social media account creation or management
3. Domain DNS configuration and SSL certificate setup for app.shuttersense.ai
4. Marketing website creation (shuttersense.ai landing page)
5. User notification/announcement system for rebrand
6. Trademark registration process
7. PyPI or npm package publication
8. Production deployment and hosting infrastructure
